"Narratives are *collaborative*, *shareable*, *publishable*, and "
"*reproducible*. We believe that Narratives help both yourself and other "
"researchers by sharing your use of Jupyter projects, technical specifics "
"of your deployment, and installation and configuration tips so that "
"others can learn from your experiences."
