"Good docstrings are very important. Unfortunately, Python itself only "
"provides a rather loose standard for docstrings [PEP257]\\_, and there is"
" no universally accepted convention for all the different parts of a "
"complete docstring. However, the NumPy project has established a very "
"reasonable standard, and has developed some tools to support the smooth "
"inclusion of such docstrings in Sphinx-generated manuals. Rather than "
"inventing yet another pseudo-standard, IPython will be henceforth "
"documented using the NumPy conventions; we carry copies of some of the "
"NumPy support tools to remain self-contained, but share back upstream "
"with NumPy any improvements or fixes we may make to the tools."

"For purely internal methods that are only likely to be read by others "
