"Academic labs have long had the tradition of the weekly lab meeting, "
"where all topics of interest to the lab are discussed. IPython has strong"
" roots in academia, but it is also an open source project that needs to "
"engage an active international community. So while our goal with IPython "
"is not to publish the next paper, we've been thinking about the value "
"these regular discussions bring to how teams work on sustained efforts "
"involving difficult problems, and wanted to bring that bit of academic "
"practice into the open source workflow. So we have decided to conduct "
"weekly \"lab meetings\" for IPython, that will be held publicly using a "
"Google Hangout on Air."
