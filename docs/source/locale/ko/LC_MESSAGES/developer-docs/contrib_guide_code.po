"Contributing to open source can be a nerve-wrecking process, but don't "
"worry everyone on the Jupyter team is dedicated to making sure that your "
"open source experience is as fun as possible. At any time during the "
"process described below, you can reach out to the Jupyter team on Gitter "
"or the mailing list for assistance. If you are nervous about asking "
"questions in public, you can also reach out to one of the Jupyter "
"developers in private. You can use the public Gitter to find someone who "
"has the best knowledge about the code you are working with and interact "

"Individuals are welcome, and encouraged, to submit pull requests and "
"contribute to the Jupyter source. If you are a first-time contributor "
"looking to get involved with Jupyter, you can use the following query in "
"a GitHub search to find beginner-friendly issues to tackle across the "
"Jupyter codebase. This query is particularly useful because the Jupyter "
"codebase is scattered across several repositories within the jupyter "
"organization, as opposed to a single repository. You can click the link "
