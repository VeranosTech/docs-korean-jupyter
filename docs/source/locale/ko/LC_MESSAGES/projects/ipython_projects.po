"IPython is a growing project, with increasingly language-agnostic "
"components. IPython 3.x was the last monolithic release of IPython, "
"containing the notebook server, qtconsole, etc. As of IPython 4.0, the "
"language-agnostic parts of the project: the notebook format, message "
"protocol, qtconsole, notebook web application, etc. have moved to new "
"projects under the name Jupyter. IPython itself is focused on interactive"
" Python, part of which is providing a Python kernel for Jupyter."
